# Introduction/Business Problem
The objective is to predict the severity of collision and determine how parameters like Wheater, RoadCond, LightCond and UnderInfl affect to drivers in some sceneries and conditions. Data helps us to understand the most common causes of collision and how to save more lives 

# Data
Some parameters like Wheater, RoadCond, LightCond and UnderInfl are important to determine if SeverityCode is a collision or injurie
